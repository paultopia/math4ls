# Why?
 
The economic analysis of law has been very influential in recent decades, particularly in basic fields such as tort and contract. Nor is this influence limited to academics: a number of important appellate judges have been involved in its propagation. In order to understand how many people think about these core areas of law, you need to be able to understand the basic ideas of law and economics. This document aims to quickly and simply explain them.
 
As an intellectual exercise, law and economics serves two related roles: 

1.  It serves an *explanatory* role: scholars and some judges have used law and economics ideas to explain why our legal doctrine is the way it is. 

2.  It serves a *normative* role: scholars and some judges have argued that law and economics generates claims about the way our legal doctrine should be.^[Note that normative arguments and explanatory arguments each feature in one another. If we think the law is generally rational, then an argument that doctrine X is a good thing (normative) also can feature in an argument about why doctrine X is the way it is (explanatory); similarly, if we think that there's value (associated with ideas like stare decisis and respecting the collective wisdom of the common law) inherent in the process of reasoning that has developed our legal system, then an explanation for doctrine X can feature in an argument for the goodness of doctrine X.] 

# Core concepts
 
## The idea of "efficiency"
 
Traditionally, law and economics has been characterized (most often in its early stages) as being interested in the use of the law to pursue "efficiency." This is an idea that has a lot of complexities buried underneath (some of which we'll explore toward the end of this document), but, for present purposes, you can think of it as the idea that we ought to maximize social welfare when we shape our legal rules. 

These days, law and economics folks do a lot more than just make arguments about what the efficient legal rule would be---empirical legal scholars with a background in economics as well as other social sciences, as well as "behavioral law and economics" folks with backgrounds in disciplines like psychology and sociology can also be understood as part of the big tent. But the most enduring ideas, especially in the 1L common law subjects like torts and contracts, have come from the conversation about efficiency, and this explainer will focus on those ideas. 

What does that mean? Well, for purposes of simplicity, we can think of social welfare in terms of money (and later on I'll briefly talk about arguments against that style of thought). Then, the intuition behind efficiency is this: suppose you can avoid some damage to my property at a cost of ten million dollars, but the cost of the actual damage is only one million dollars.^[When I say "cost" in this document, please assume that I also mean things like foregone opportunities, lost profits, etc.] If our tort system gives you an incentive to pay the cost to avoid the damage, then it's inefficient because it induces wasteful behavior---it would be like collectively setting nine million dollars on fire. 

By contrast, suppose that you can avoid the damage for ten dollars. Then a tort system that gives you an incentive to do so will be efficient, but one that gives you a disincentive to do so will be inefficient---it will waste $999,990 of social value. 

For now, let's work with this notion of efficiency as a thing to be pursued. We'll unwrap the complexities slowly.^[Through this document, I will be speaking---for the sake of simplicity---just about "money," but you can read that to mean "social welfare in general," and should assume (we'll talk about it) that all other things people value can be seamlessly translated to dollars.]

### Note for philosophers:

Talk about maximizing social welfare requires one to accept the moral idea, associated with philosophical traditions like utilitarianism, that well-being, however understood (preference satisfaction, happiness, etc.---usually preference satisfaction on the economist's style of thought) is worth pursuing. However, you don't need to be A Utilitarian(TM) to think that social welfare is worth pursuing: even a Kantian surely has some reason to support bringing about states of affairs in which everyone is richer over states of affairs in which everyone is poorer, so long as no moral imperatives have to be violated in the process. 

## Coase Theorem

One of the central ideas of law and economics suggests that under some circumstances legal rules might not even matter! An economist called Ronald Coase once famously defended what has become known as the Coase Theorem: 

*If transaction costs are zero, any allocation of rights will lead to an efficient outcome.*

Let's unpack that. 

- *Transaction costs* means any costs associated with bargaining and making binding trades. This includes, for example, costs associated with learning about potential bargains, negotiating, enforcing contracts, organizing collective interests, physically transferring goods, etc.

- *Allocation of rights* means any rights: property rights, tort rights against damage, etc.

Why might we think the Coase Theorem is true?  Well, let's think of this in terms of an example. 

Suppose that I own a plot of land uphill from yours, and a stream runs downhill through both of our lands. There are lots of things I might do to screw up this stream: I could pollute it, I could divert it, I could break its banks and cause it to flood your land, or I could just use up all the water before it gets to you. 

But suppose that you and I can make instant and costless deals. Then it might not matter whether I have the right to do whatever I want to the stream, or whether I have to do something to preserve your interests downstream.

Let's imagine that I have some destructive use for the stream that will make me a million dollars in profit. However, you're using the stream right now, and you're also making some profit from your use. 

If you're making, say, ten million dollars in profit, then if I don't have the right to screw up the stream, the law just dictates the efficient outcome. But even if I do have the right to screw up the stream, you should be able to pay me anything between $1,000,001 and $9,999,999 to forego doing so in order to preserve your more-profitable activity. After all, doing so will be profitable for both of us.

On the other hand, if your existing use of the stream is only bringing you, say, $100,000 in profits, then if the law gives me the right to screw it up, it's already the efficient result. But even if the law gives you the right to keep me from destroying it (or punish me if I do so), I should be able to pay you anything between $100,001 and $999,999 to let me divert/pollute/whatever the stream. 

More generally, the Coase Theorem suggests that whenever the law allocates property and tort rights in an inefficient way, that will mean there's someone (or some group of people) who is *losing* more money than the person, or group of people, who is *making* money by the inefficient allocation. (Basically, this is because that's what efficiency means---see the discussion of the Kaldor-Hicks idea below.)

So why haven't we thrown away the whole legal theorem? Simple: *there are always transaction costs*. 

One potential implication of the Coase Theorem is that, all else being equal, maybe we ought to arrange the legal system to reduce transaction costs, but apart from that, it just represents a kind of limiting case for the rest of the theoretical framework.

For the rest of this explainer, we'll assume that we're talking about situations where there are significant transaction costs.

## Internalizing Externalities

An "externality" is a cost or a benefit associated with an activity that falls on someone else. For example, if my factory pollutes the stream, then the losses to others from the polluted stream are negative externalities. (Any benefits that I produce with my factory for the community as a whole, but which don't turn into dollars in my pocket, are positive externalities.)

One fairly simple economic idea is that we're more likely to get efficient outcomes if the legal system causes people to internalize their externalities, that is, pay for the costs (and accrue the benefits) of their own activity rather than imposing them on others. For example, if I have to pay for the pollution my factory causes, and also receive all the benefits of my factory, then I will only continue to operate the factory if the total benefits exceed the total costs---that is, if it's efficient. 

## Least cost Avoider

The idea of the least cost avoider is that if we're deciding to whom to allocate the cost (a.k.a. risk) of a accident, we should allocate it to the person who avoids it at the lowest cost. For example, if it will cost me $100 to take a precaution to avoid damaging your property, but it would cost you $500 to protect your property from the damage, then, all else being equal, we should allocate the cost to me. 

Why?  The easiest explanation is that if the accident is to be avoided, why should we waste the $400? 

Here's an only slightly more complicated explanation that will require a little algebra. Suppose the damage to someone's property (it doesn't matter whose) would cost C, suppose the cost to party A for avoiding it is Y, and the cost to party B for avoiding it is Z. No matter which party bears the risk of damage, they will pay to avoid it if and only if the cost for them to do so is less than the cost of the damage. 

Let us further suppose that $Y > Z$, that is, that B is the least cost avoider. 

If $C > Y$, then necessarily $C > Z$, and so either party will pay to avoid the risk, but if we allocate it to B, we save $Y-Z$ in total social cost relative to the alternative allocation, $Y > Z$, so we know that is a real savings.  Sweet, sweet, efficiency.

If $Y > C > Z$, then if we allocate the risk to A, they'll just let it happen and pay the damages/suffer the injury rather than pay to prevent it. That will cause a net social loss of C. But if we allocate the risk to B, they'll pay to prevent it, causing a net social loss of Z. Since $C > Z$ that means that allocating the risk to B saves $C-Z$ which is strictly positive.

If $Z > C$, then necessarily $Y > C$, and neither party will pay to avoid the risk. So we just experience a net social loss of C no matter what happens.

In two of the three logically possibly scenarios, allocating the risk to the least cost avoider is efficient; in the third it makes no difference either way. 

## Property rules and liability rules

## Efficient breach

An efficient breach is an idea in contracts that serves as an analogy to the situations in tort law when it might be more efficient to let a harm happen rather than take care to prevent it. Suppose you have a contract with me that brings $20 in profit to you and $20 in profit to me. Now suppose that an opportunity arises for you to something that makes you $50 in profit, but in order to do so, you would have to break the contract with me (e.g., by selling the unique goods that you promised me to someone else who values them lots more.). We would call that an "efficient breach" because it would lead to a net social gain of $10---and thanks to the fact that contract law only provides for expectation damages, we'd expect that you would actually carry it out. 
 
## Cost-benefit analysis 

## Behavioral law and economics

Much of traditional law and economics is predicated on the supposition that participants in the legal system are "rational," in the sense of doing things like comparing choices available to them with respect to some common currency, having consistent values for options with identical expected values, etc.^[For a description of the concept of expected value, see the probability explainer in this series.] However, there's a lot of psychological evidence suggesting that maybe people don't actually work that way.

# Digging in on "Efficiency"

(problem with pure cash isn't necessarily bad, though it might be, depending on what you think about the commensurability of values.  read ruth chang.  )

(problem with interpersonal comparisions of utility is much bigger.  dollar to you isnt same as dollar to me.)
